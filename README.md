The PC Health Check app from Microsoft allows you to check the current condition of your computer and tells Windows 10 users whether their system is capable of handling Windows 11 in all its glory. The PC Health Check app can either be downloaded from Microsoftâ€™s website for free or could be installed via Windows Update. 

The PC Health Check app is not revolutionary by any means but it can be a useful addition to your application library.


## Why do you need PC Health Check app?

For any Windows 10 user, the PC Health Check app basically dictates whether you are eligible to get Windows 11. If you are not eligible for the new OS, you are told which components need replacing or upgrading. 

The application also allows you to check which applications run when you boot your PC, gives you tips to improve your performance, tells you how much storage space you have available on your computer, and more. The PC Health Check app does not exactly do anything that you cannot do by yourself. However, having the ability to change so many settings on the fly is certainly worth a look.
